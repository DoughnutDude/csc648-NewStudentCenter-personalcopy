# DoughnutDude's personal copy of New Student Center SWE Project
This project tested our skills as a software engineering team by having us develop and deploy a website over the course of 1 semester.
We decided to create a redesigned student center for students to enroll in classes, access student records, and manage their school life.

Our team was split roughly in half between front-end and back-end teams.

I played the role of database manager and back-end engineer.

The work was split into 5 milestones over the course of the semester:
- Use cases, functional/non-functional requirements, and competitive analysis.
- Requirement prioritization, UX mockups/storyboarding, and vertical prototyping.
- Back-end/database architecture diagramming, UI design, and front-end horizontal prototyping.
- Usability and QA testing, back-end API implementation, and Beta prototyping.
- Final project submission, fine-tuning.
